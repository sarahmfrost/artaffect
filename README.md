ArtAffect is an interactive web application that creates a novel engagement with art collections. In contrast with presentations that organize art by genre, medium, or style, ArtAffect lets users visually organize a database of visual art in terms of a series of affect parameters that describe the emotional content of the artworks. We present ArtAffect’s three main interaction methods, each of which provides a different type of guided navigation through the dataset. Our *Sliders* interface encourages users to explore the database by manipulating five sliders that correspond to five affect qualities (love, positive emotion, anger, anxiety, sadness). The *Carousel* interface provides a tour through a subset of art pieces with the highest emotional valence along one affect vector. Finally, our *Gradient* interface gives the user the ability to explore the affect space spanned by narrator-selected pieces of visual art. Together, these three methods act as a playful exploration mechanic that presents art in unexpected ways, showing serendipitous connections between diverse artworks within the collection. These serendipitous connections can increase a user’s feelings of engagement and excitement.
